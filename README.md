# Intelligent Academic Chatbot for College Curriculum Subjects

## Document Analysis and Conversational Agent

This project, **Intelligent Academic Chatbot**, is designed to assist students and educators in exploring and understanding college curriculum subjects more effectively. The chatbot is powered by advanced language models and vector-based search, allowing users to upload academic documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and interact with a conversational agent that provides accurate and context-aware responses based on the content of those documents.

The system is tailored to analyze educational documents, extract key information, and facilitate seamless Q&A sessions, making it an ideal tool for simplifying academic inquiries, preparing for exams, or revisiting lecture materials.

## Project Features

1. **Document Upload and Management**:
   - Supports common document formats: PDF, DOCX, and TXT.
   - Allows multiple document uploads for comprehensive analysis.

2. **Automated Document Processing**:
   - Extracts textual content from uploaded documents.
   - Breaks content into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient querying.
   - Handles complex documents with headings, tables, and bullet points.

3. **Conversational AI**:
   - Employs a **Groq-powered Large Language Model (LLM)** for intelligent question-answering.
   - Provides precise and contextually relevant answers.
   - Retains the history of queries for ongoing conversational context.

4. **FAISS Vector Store Integration**:
   - Uses **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** to index document embeddings and retrieve the most relevant information.
   - Leverages **HuggingFace models** for creating robust embeddings.

5. **Persistent Query Memory**:
   - Maintains conversational flow by remembering previous interactions.
   - Enhances user experience by providing continuity across multiple queries.

6. **Scalability and Customization**:
   - Easily extendable for additional features such as summarization or translation.
   - Suitable for a wide range of academic subjects and document types.

## Technical Prerequisites

To run the project, ensure the following:

- Python 3.x (tested on Python 3.7+)
- Groq API Key (required for accessing ChatGroq’s language model)
- Proper environment configuration through a `.env` file.

---

## Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-academic-chatbot.git
   cd intelligent-academic-chatbot
   ```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
   Use `pip` to install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you use a virtual environment, activate it before running the above command.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory.
   - Add your Groq API key:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
     ```

   ⚠️ **Important**: Do not share or commit the `.env` file to any public repository.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Process Documents:
   - Add your academic documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) to the `./documents` folder.
   - Run the ingestion script to process the documents and build the vector store:
     ```bash
     python ingest.py
     ```
   - The script extracts text, splits it into chunks, generates embeddings, and saves them for fast retrieval.

### 2. Interact with the Chatbot:
   - Start the chatbot interface:
     ```bash
     python chat.py
     ```
   - Once launched, you can begin asking subject-specific questions, and the chatbot will retrieve answers based on your uploaded documents.

---

## Example Use Case

1. **Upload Academic Documents**: 
   Upload course notes, textbooks, or curriculum files to the `./documents` folder.

2. **Ingest Content**:
   Run the `ingest.py` script to extract and preprocess the document content.

3. **Ask Questions**:
   Launch the chatbot and query topics like *"What is the definition of Machine Learning?"* or *"Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning based on the curriculum."*

4. **Get Contextual Answers**:
   The chatbot will analyze the document embeddings and respond with precise, relevant information.

## .gitignore Configuration

The `.gitignore` file ensures sensitive or unnecessary files are excluded from version control:

- `.env` file (to protect API keys and configurations)
- Virtual environment directories (`venv/`, `env/`)
- Temporary files and caches (`*.pyc`, `__pycache__/`)
- FAISS vector store files (`*.pkl`)
